# m3u-epg-editor
An m3u / epg file optimizer script written in python

m3u-epg-editor enables download of m3u / epg files from a remote (or local) server and enables the channel groups and channels within these files to be trimmed, optimized and reordered

These features might be useful where:

1. You want to achieve a filtered list and an improved custom sort order of TV channels
2. You have an underpowered device where SPMC / KODI / some other app running on that device struggles to download and process very large m3u / epg files
3. Your service provider supplies you with a url that returns an m3u file containing both live TV channels and VOD content in that one file and you want to filter it to contain only live TV channels

This script has been tested with the following IPTV providers:

1. **VaderStreams**
2. **FabIPTV**
3. **NecroIPTV**

VaderStreams ~~do~~ did support a unique feature to enable filtering groups within their m3u in the HTTP GET request/response via a `filterCategory` query string parameter. However there are some issues that are common to all IPTV service providers where there is no obvious, easy or free solution:

1. There is no method to remove specific channels within categories / groups
2. There is no method to re-order / sort channels within categories / groups to achieve a desired custom sort order
3. There is no method to reduce the volume of data within the epg to include only those channels that are required
4. There is no method to reduce the time window of data within the epg

There are commercially available online services that can solve these problems for a monthly / yearly subscription free.

m3u-epg-editor solves these problems for free on your own network / computer(s).

#### dependencies:
`python`

* m3u-epg-editor-py3.py is intended for use with Python v3.x. m3u-epg-editor-py3.py is currently being maintained.
* m3u-epg-editor-py2.py is / was intended for use with Python v2.7. Official support for Python v2.7 ended on 01/01/2020, ref: [https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/344](https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/344) and [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/). m3u-epg-editor-py2.py is no longer being maintained in this repo, please do not request any further maintenance changes to m3u-epg-editor-py2.py.

Python installers can be downloaded from the official python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
In linux, Python can also be installed from a package repository with a package manager i.e. `apt`, `yum` etc or a software manager i.e. synaptic

  --xml_sort_type [XML_SORT_TYPE], -xs [XML_SORT_TYPE]
                        Specify "alpha" or "m3u" to control how channel elements within the

                        populated with elements for channels in the m3u file that normally would
                        have no EPG data (default: False)

```

#### Supplying arguments via a JSON configuration file:
All runtime arguments can be supplied via the file described by the `--json_cfg / -j` path. There is a sample JSON configuration file [here](./sample_input_args.json). When arguments are supplied via a JSON configuration file in the `--json_cfg / -j` argument, all arguments are expected to passed in that JSON configuration file and any arguments that are passed via the cli will be ignored. In other words, use `--json_cfg / -j` for all arguments or pass all individual arguments via the cli but do not attempt to use both.

#### files created by this script:

![files](./screenshots/files-screenshot-2018-01-23-21.57.28.png)

Each time this script is run, the following files will be created / overwritten in the specified `--outdirectory / -d` path:

* **original.m3u**

   This is the original unmodified m3u file downloaded from the specified `--m3uurl / -m` remote server
   
* **original.channels.txt**

   This is a raw text file log that contains an unfiltered list of all channel names from the original m3u
   
* **original.gz**

   This is the original unmodified epg gzip file downloaded from the specified `--epgurl / -e` remote server. No EPG processing is performed when the optional `--no_epg / -ne` argument is supplied.
   
* **original.xml**

   This is the original unmodified epg xml file extracted from the original epg gzip file. No EPG processing is performed when the optional `--no_epg / -ne` argument is supplied.
   
* **[--outfilename].m3u**

   This is the new rewritten m3u file created from the original m3u file. This will contain all of the channels that you've decided to keep. Channels are optionally sorted according to the sort order specified in `--sortchannels / -s`. If `--no_sort / -ns` is specified, anything supplied in `--sortchannels / -s` is ignored.
   
* **[--outfilename].channels.txt**

   This is basically a raw text file log containing the list of channel names from the original m3u that you've decided to keep. This can be useful for constructing a desired `--sortchannels / -s` sort order.
   
* **[--outfilename].xml**

   This is the new rewritten epg file created from the original epg file that contains epg data for all of the channels that you've decided to keep. If `--range / -r` was specified, epg data will be filtered to only include entries that fall within the range window of `range_start <= programme_start <= range_end`. No EPG file will be created when the optional `--no_epg / -ne` argument is supplied.
   
* **no_epg_channels.txt**

   This is a log of any channels that you decided to keep that were subsequently found to have no epg data available. This can be useful to help to construct a list of `--channels / -c` channels to exclude if i.e. you only want to keep those channels where epg data is available
